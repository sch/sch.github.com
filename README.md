Website for Adrian Schaedle.

It's implemented as a Jekyll blog, with some additional pieces that allow
building assets [outside of Jekyll's restrictions for
github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/).

```
$ rake --tasks
rake default  # Generate HTML files once
rake develop  # Start a server for local development
rake new      # Wizard for a new post in stock/_posts
rake publish  # Generate and publish blog to gh-pages
```

The theme for this website is available at
[sch/jekyll-theme](https://github.com/sch/jekyll-theme).
