The tl;dr of [this article](http://www.jayway.com/2012/08/01/combining-html-hypermedia-apis-and-adaptive-web-design/):

> HTML is the lowest common denominator in a world were the number of devices are steadily growing. In such a world, our API should be hypermedia driven and we should consider choosing HTML as the media type for our APIs. If we choose this, we can enhance the API with CSS and JavaScript, making the API human-friendly as well. Further, we can use Adaptive Web Design to make the best possible experience for all types of browsers and devices.

I hear the same things over and over when people beg us to consider web standards: screen readers, and search engines. Good markup provides good structure to the audio interface for blind users, which is something most take for granted when scanning a page visually. And markup with meaning embedded in the text itself helps Google to parse the structure and meaning of a document for search relevance and Knowledge Graph padding, though this is only one of hundreds of attributes that contribute to Google's algorithms.

I'm sick of it.
