      <div class="Project-title">Sol LeWitt</div>
      <div class="Project-description">
        Sol LeWitt was the father of "conceptual art", a movement that sold a description of how an artwork should be created, and left the work to the artist who would implement it. This project re-imagines many of the works at <a href="http://www.massmoca.org/lewitt/">Mass MoCA</a> for computers to perform. <a href="https://github.com/sch/sol-lewitt">Github link</a>

      <div class="Project-title">Drawing Machine</div>
      <div class="Project-description">
        Plotting has traditionally been done on a cartesian plane with bands that move along the X and Y axis, but a point on a plane can also be calculated from the intersection of two circles. This project lets gravity do a little bit of work to create a drafting machine that can be mounted on a wall. <em>Coming Soon</em>
