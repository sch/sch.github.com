    <div class="Project-description">
      Sol LeWitt was the father of "conceptual art", a movement that sold a description of how an artwork should be created, and left the work to the artist who would implement it. This project re-imagines many of the works at <a href="http://www.massmoca.org/lewitt/">Mass MoCA</a> for computers to perform.

      Nothing has a steadier hand than what you can create with a couple of stepper motors. This project lets gravity and a bit of hardware do the hard work of plotting.
