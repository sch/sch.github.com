I'm a programmer and designer specializing in communication software. That is,
software designed to facilitate people working together to reduce ambiguity,
remove ego, and express complex ideas â€” software that helps everyone get on the
same page.

I've worked with dynamic object-oriented languages (Python, Ruby, Javascript),
dynamic functional languages (Clojure, Elixir, Racket), low-level languages (C,
Go, Forth), and statically typed functional languages (OCaml, Elm).

My main outlet for this kind of work has been through UI development, but
extends to back-end and system development. This means designing around data
rather than specific algorithms or architecture, eliminating mutability and side
effects to make applications easier to reason about, and above all,
understanding people's needs and finding the most humane solution to a problem.
