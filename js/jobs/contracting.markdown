Since February 2017, I have been a contractor working with various companies to
design and program software.

Through [Oak](https://oak.is), I helped design and build [the School for Visual
Arts student portfolio site](http://sva.design).

Through [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com), I helped textbook publisher Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt prototype alternative textbook interactions and assessment
software.

With [Standard Library](https://standard-library.com) and [IN-FO
CO](http://in-fo.co), I built the exhibition site for the [2018 US Architectural
Pavilion](http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org) at the Venice Biennale.

Currently I'm working with Adidas to build internal tools to make supply chain
and garment embellishment information more visible.

This work has touched many different technologies, including Kubernetes, React,
GraphQL, Typescript, Swagger, gRPC, Postgres, Ruby, Elixir, and Elm.
