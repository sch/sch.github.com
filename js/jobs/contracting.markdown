Since February 2017, I have been a contractor working with various companies to
design and program software.

Through [Oak](https://oak.is), I helped design and build [the School for Visual
Arts student portfolio site](http://sva.design).

Through [Reaktor](https://www.reaktor.com), I helped textbook publisher Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt prototype alternative textbook interactions and assessment
software.

Currently with Reaktor, I've worked to build internal tools for Adidas to make
supply chain and garment embellishment information more visible.

With [Standard Library](https://standard-library.com) and [IN-FO
CO](http://in-fo.co), I am working to build the exhibition site for the [2018 US
Architectural Pavilion](http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org) at the Venice
Biennale.

This work has touched many different technologies, including Kubernetes, React,
GraphQL, Typescript, Swagger, gRPC, Postgres, Ruby, Elixir, and Elm.
