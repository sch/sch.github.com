      <h3 id="wccs-wheaton-college-radio">WCCS: Wheaton College Radio</h3>
      <h2>Technical Director, Music Director, DJ</h2>
      <h3>2008-2012</h3>
      <p>I kept the lights on in our seriously underfunded radio station. As a technical director, I engineered and built our school’s recording studio, created a full stack of software for song rotation and audio streaming (both internet and FM), designed and maintained our web site, and most importantly, trained some brilliant kids to take over the station when I left. I also held a music radio show for four years, talked with promoters and record labels to get a steady flow of new music mailed to us, worked out legal and financial responsibilities with music licensing, and hired the occasional band to come out and play.</p>
      <h3>Wheaton College Physics Department</h3>
      <h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
      <h3 class="dates">2009-2010</h3>
      <p>I assisted in teaching two semesters of our department’s Intro Physics classes. This was mostly grading papers, though I did get to provide tutoring and review sessions, and set up fun (and slightly dangerous) demonstration experiments during class time.</p>

      <p><strong>Javascript</strong>: Solid knowledge of jQuery, Backbone and Spine MVC frameworks, and cross-scripting/third-party-javascript techniques</p>
      <p>Ruby: Strong experience with Sinatra framework for single-page web apps and API design, familiarity with Rails</p>
      <p>Python: Used for most classes at Wheaton, though I’ve used Django extensively f</p>
      <p>C/C++: The other popular school language, though taught by a pretty seasoned teacher who has forever drilled pointers and memory management into my fingers</p>
