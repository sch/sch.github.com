I'm a programmer who loves to build user interfaces. I take inspiration from
functional programming, Xerox Parc research, physics, and graphic design.

I've worked with dynamic object-oriented languages (Python, Ruby, Javascript),
dynamic functional languages (Clojure, Racket), low-level languages (C, Go,
Forth), and statically typed functional languages (OCaml, Elm).

Though my focus is on UI development, my passion lies in decomposing hard
problems into well-factored systems. This means designing around data rather
than specific algorithms or architecture, eliminating mutability and side
effects to make applications easier to reason about, and above all, working
to find the simplest solution to a problem.
