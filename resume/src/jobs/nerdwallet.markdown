Split a big PHP codebase into a smaller PHP codebase and a handful of Python
services. Maintained the Wordpress blogs for 40+ authors, and built a handful
of editor extensions: macros for things like credit card previews, up-to-date
stock prices, and arbitrary text snippets. Moved a bunch of the site to a responsive
redesign, migrated 25+ repositories to a single Github deployment, and
supervised/code reviewed work for one of our remote teams.
