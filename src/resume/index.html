design and program software.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://oak.is">Oak</a>, I helped design and build <a href="http://sva.design">the School for Visual
Arts student portfolio site</a>.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://www.reaktor.com">Reaktor</a>, I helped textbook publisher Houghton
Mifflin Harcourt prototype alternative textbook interactions and assessment
software.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://standard-library.com">Standard Library</a> and <a href="http://in-fo.co">IN-FO
CO</a>, I built the exhibition site for the <a href="http://dimensionsofcitizenship.org">2018 US Architectural
Pavilion</a> at the Venice Biennale.</p>
<p>Currently I&#39;m working with Adidas to build internal tools to make supply chain
and garment embellishment information more visible.</p>
<p>This work has touched many different technologies, including Kubernetes, React,
GraphQL, Typescript, Swagger, gRPC, Postgres, Ruby, Elixir, and Elm.</p>

internet-of-things wifi-enabled <a href="http://littlebits.cc/cloudstart">cloudBit</a>.
This application was responsible for controlling and reading values from
devices over a websocket connection, provisioning a device on a wifi network,
and setting up recipes using If This Then That.</p>
<p>I helped to tune our aging Rails app to boost throughput using our existing AWS
configuration. I led a revamp of our community-powered invention editor, where
littleBits users can submit pictures and instructions about how to build their
creations.</p>
<p>After this I worked in a research-and-development capactiy on an upcoming
<a href="http://littlebits.cc/code-kit">learn-to-code product</a> aimed at the education
market.</p>
<p>On the programming side, I split time between developing user interface
prototypes for high-level product design considerations and building out
necessary libraries for communicating with hardware from a web context.  This
included a wrapper around the (at-the-time experimental) Web Bluetooth apis,
a Javascript binary parser and generator library for a USB bluetooth dongle,
a Qt app (later an Electron app) that could provide a websocket connection to
our Arduino runtime.  On the web side, I experimented with various paradigms
that could be used as a basis for teaching programming, including procedural,
event-based, declarative, and functional reactive programming. These prototypes
were implemented using web technologies.</p>
<p>Non-programming duties included performing market research and competitive
analysis for the learn-to-code software space, sourcing and synthesizing
relevant academic research, administering user testing with kids in public
schools, interviewing educators to gain insight into how programming is taught
today, and talking to teams at Google, Microsoft, Apple, and the Lifelong
Kindergarten Group to suggest points of collaboration.</p>
